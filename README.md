# Brewdog IPython Notebook
An IPython notebook exploring the Punk API (Brewdog's open beer API) with some data visualisation using Plotly.

The notebook grabs beer data from the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/). This includes such items as ingredients, ABV and IBU.

Beer data is analysed within Dataframes using Pandas, and Plotly is used to create an animated bar chart, showing Brewdog's change in popularity of hops each year.
